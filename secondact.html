        <h6 class="MISS_TESMAN1">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
        <p class="speech_MISS_TESMAN">Nor I.--But by-the-bye, Berta--while I think of it: in future you
            mustn't say Master George. You must say Dr. Tesman.</p>
        <h6 class="BERTA1">BERTA.</h6>
        <p class="speech_BERTA">Yes, the young mistress spoke of that too--last night--the moment they
            set foot in the house. Is it true then, Miss?</p>
        <h6 class="MISS_TESMAN1">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
        <p class="speech_MISS_TESMAN">Yes, indeed it is. Only think, Berta--some foreign university has made
            him a doctor--while he has been abroad, you understand. I hadn't heard a
            word about it, until he told me himself upon the pier.</p>
        <h6 class="BERTA1">BERTA.</h6>
        <p class="speech_BERTA">Well well, he's clever enough for anything, he is. But I didn't think
            he'd have gone in for doctoring people. </p>
        <h6 class="MISS_TESMAN1">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
        <p class="speech_MISS_TESMAN">No no, it's not that sort of doctor he is. [Nods significantly.] But
            let me tell you, we may have to call him something still grander before
            long.</p>
        <h6 class="BERTA1">BERTA.</h6>
        <p class="speech_BERTA">You don't say so! What can that be, Miss?</p>
