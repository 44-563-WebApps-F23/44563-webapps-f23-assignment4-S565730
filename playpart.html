<h6 class="MISS_TESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
<p1 class="direction">[Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:]</p1> 
<p class="speech_MISS_TESMAN">Upon my word, I don't believe they are stirring yet!</p>
<h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6>
<p1 class="direction">[Also softly.]</p1>
<p class="speech_BERTA">I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.</p> 
<h6 class="MISS_TESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
<p class="speech_MISS_TESMAN">Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.</p>
<p1 class="direction">[She goes to the glass door and throws it open].</p1>
<h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6>
<p1 class="direction">[Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]</p1>
<p class="speech_BERTA">I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
Miss. </p>
<p1 class="direction">[She places it on the piano].</p1>
<h6 class="MISS_TESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
<p class="speech_MISS_TESMAN">So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
wrench to me to part with you.</p>
<h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6>
<p1 class="direction">[On the point of weeping.] </p1>
<p class="speech_BERTA">And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1)</p>
<h6 class="MISS_TESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
<p class="speech_MISS_TESMAN">We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
to look after him ever since he was a little boy.</p>
<h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6>
<p class="speech_BERTA">Ah but, Miss Julia, I can't help thinking of Miss Rina lying helpless
at home there, poor thing. And with only that new girl too! She'll never
learn to take proper care of an invalid.</p>
<h6 class="MISS_TESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
<p class="speech_MISS_TESMAN">Oh, I shall manage to train her. And of course, you know, I shall take
most of it upon myself. You needn't be uneasy about my poor sister, my
dear Berta.</p>
<h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6>
<p class="speech_BERTA">Well, but there's another thing, Miss. I'm so mortally afraid I shan't
be able to suit the young mistress.</p>
<h6 class="MISS_TESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
<p class="speech_MISS_TESMAN">Oh well--just at first there may be one or two things--</p>
<h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6>
<p class="speech_BERTA">Most like she'll be terrible grand in her ways.</p>
<h6 class="MISS_TESMAN">MISS TESMAN</h6>
<p class="speech_MISS_TESMAN">Well, you can't wonder at that--General Gabler's daughter! Think of
the sort of life she was accustomed to in her father's time. Don't you
remember how we used to see her riding down the road along with the
General? In that long black habit--and with feathers in her hat?</p>
<h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6>
<p class="speech_BERTA">Yes, indeed--I remember well enough!--But, good Lord, I should never
have dreamt in those days that she and Master George would make a match
of it.</p>
